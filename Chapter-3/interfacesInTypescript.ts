/**
 * NOTE 1
 * ---------
 * An interface is a shape of an object.
 * A standard JavaScript object is a map of key:value pairs.
 * JavaScript object keys in almost all the cases are strings and their values are any supported JavaScript values (primitive or abstract).
 * 
 * NOTE-2
 * ---------
 * An interface tells the TypeScript compiler about property names an object can have and their corresponding value types.
 * Therefore, interface is a type and is an abstract type since it is composed of primitive types.
 * 
 * NOTE-3
 * ---------
 * When we define an object with properties (keys) and values,
 * TypeScript creates an implicit interface by looking at the property names and data type of their values in the object.
 * (please see the attached image implicitIterface.png for reference).
 * This happens because of the type inference.
 *
